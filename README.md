# I am creating a program in C to implement a Queue.<br>
This program will support various operations on the queue:<br>
1 : Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.<br>
2 : Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.<br>
3 : Get front element: Retrieve the element at the front of the queue without removing it.<br>
4 : Get rear element: Retrieve the element at the rear of the queue without removing it.<br>
5 : Display Queue: Print all elements of the queue.<br>
# Additionally, I am implementing a Double Ended Queue (Deque) with the same functionalities as the queue. However, the Deque will have additional features allowing elements to be deleted from both the front and rear sides of the queue.
